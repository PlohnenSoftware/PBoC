```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(BoolNet)
library(igraph)

# Load the network
HSC <- loadNetwork("hsc.txt")
```



```{r}
attr <- getAttractors(HSC)
plotStateGraph(attr)
print(attr)

```
Attractor 4 is the one that is closest to the experimental HSPC expression profile 11101111111 - 11100111111(Attractor 4)


```{r}
attr <- getAttractors(HSC, type="asynchronous",
method="random", startStates=500)
print(attr)
```


Attractor 3 appears to be an assynchronous attractor because it is a complex/loose attractor
